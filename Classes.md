# Java Vs Swift Class Compairison

## Defining a class

Classes are defined using the “Class” Keyword, and are private, protected, or public
    
```java
public static void main() {
    //This is a class in java

}
```

Must be own file
Can be Abstract
New instances with “new {className}” convention
Dont need
Without, compiler creates a no argument constructor, which calls the superclass’s no arg constructor.
Can (and should) Create
Can have multiple with different signatures
Different use cases of object
 No Destructing 
All classes inherit finalize method, only used as a last resort to release resources, and only really called at the garbage collector’s discretion
