# Lambda Expressions

## Java Lambda Expressions

* Lambda expressions can be used to pass functionality as an argument to other methods, essentially treating code as data.
* Lambda expressions also give coders the ability to write single-method classes in a concise and clean manner.

```Java
public class Person {
	private int age;
	private int height;
}

public class myClass {
	private Person p;
	
	bool checkPerson
}

```

## Swift Lambda Expressions
