## Swift Data Types

* Swift supports two types of data types: named types and compound types.
* Named types include those that can be given a name when defined, such as classes, structures, enumerations, protocols, and even data types considered primitive types in other languages, like numbers, characters, booleans, and strings.
* Compound types are types without names. Only functions and tuples are compound types, and are defined in Swift itself.
* One can specify the type of a variable or expression with type annotation. In the example below, the parameter num is specified to have the type Int.

```Swift example of Type Annotation

func myFunction(num: Int) { /* implementation */ }

```

* Types in Swift all fall into one of two other categories: Value types and Reference types.
* Instances that keep a unique copy of their data are value types.
* Instances sharing a single copy of data are called reference types.
